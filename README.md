# WriterHistory
It's like a github for word documents

## Background
Large blogging and content developing companies need version control for multiple users editing the same document.

## Competition
Notion and google docs.

## Problem
Word document collaboration tools like google docs and notion are missing features for supporting multiple document versions and facilitating merging.

## Solution
WriterHistory aims to implement git-like features to word document management.

## Advantages over competition
* Assisted word document merges
* Track changes
* Tools for offline document changes

## Audience
Small and Medium sized content-creation businesses. Can be used personally too.

## Project Status
So far, this project is just an idea. However this idea was suggested by industry professionals. Perhaps the exit strategy is to be acquired by a bigger productivity software company such as Notion or Google Documents.

## Team Members needed
- A business analyst for determining any other potential uses for the idea and identify pitfalls and solutions.
- Marketer for determining the marketing strategy
